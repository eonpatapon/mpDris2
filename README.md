Logout/login from your session.
Default prefix is ``/usr/local``.

# Configuration

By default, mpDris2 will try to connect to localhost:6600.

To set a different host or port copy the example configuration file
``/usr/[local]/share/doc/mpdris2/mpDris2.conf`` to ``~/.config/mpDris2/mpDris2.conf``.

Use the configuration to enable notifications and multimedia keys support (on
the GNOME desktop).

You need also to set the ``music_dir`` option and have the Python ``mutagen``
module installed for mpDris2 to export covers paths in the MPRIS metadata.

Restart your session or mpDris2 after changing mpDris2.conf.
